This project involves the classification of various cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, using a transformer-based model called BiViT architecture. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, a large comparative analysis is performed with several other transfer learning algorithms, such as DenseNet121, ResNet101, VGG19, EfficientNet B0, and deep autoencoders. The results indicate that the proposed BiViT architecture performs significantly better than the other models in the classification of Alzheimer's disease. This highlights the potential of transformer-based models like BiViT in improving the accuracy of diagnosis and advancing our understanding of neurocognitive disorders.
